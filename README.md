I was thinking about how to change color bar on blazor menu, because it uses boostrap 5 and i don't want to use style in html code, so i went to stack overflow and i found an answer about that, some people had the same question, a person had this shape to resolve that:

He said "You need to change this code on MainLayout"

<div class="sidebar">
    <NavMenu />
</div>

for this:

<div style="background-image:none;background-color:cadetblue;" class="sidebar">
    <NavMenu />
</div>
